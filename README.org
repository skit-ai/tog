#+TITLE: tog

Tagging interface for NLP-ish data. Specifically for entity region tagging as
shown here:

[[file:./screen-tagged.png]]

-----

To start using tog, you need to generate a data file and then start Emacs with
~tog-mode~ on this file. The file is based on the following structure:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# This is a comment
# The next line specifies the tags (space separated) that we are going to use
# in this file
# tog-types: LOC NAME TIME

# Each text is represented in a single like starting with a unique (integer)
# identifier. For example:

1323: This is my sentence
2323: Another sentence, with one entity (next monday)
#+END_EXAMPLE

For tagging, you can either install this package or just run Emacs standalone
and load only tog (and its dependencies). Following steps are needed to do the
later:

1. Install Emacs and [[https://github.com/cask/cask][cask]].
2. In this directory run ~cask init~ to install dependencies locally.
3. Run ~./tog.sh~ and open the ~.tog~ file you want to tag.
